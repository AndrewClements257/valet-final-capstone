# Let's Taco About It Final Capstone

The purpose of this final capstone was to create a valet application that was to be used at a fine dining establishment called Let's Taco About It. 

Whenever a customer pulls up to the valet, the valet can enter in the customer and vehicle information. They choose the spot and then give the customer their ticket number. 

After creating an account the user can enter in their ticket number to see their current time accrued in the lot and total amount owed. After they hit submit, they are then told that their vehicle is ready to be picked up and they are shown a game in order to give them something to do while they wait, if they so choose.

Back at the valet side of things, when a customer requests a pickup a big attention grabbing warning is displayed to alert the valet. 

On the login screen, anyone can see how many spots are available in the parking lot, with a warning if the lot is full. The actual current weather information for Mount Washington, Pittsburgh PA, which is where this imaginary restaurant is located, is shown in the top right corner. They can also see the lovely logo I created for this restaurant at the top-center of the screen.

In the register user screen, if you know the secret code, Hint: valet, you can register as a valet too!

Don't forget to run the database script and have the back end rand front end running if you wish to try it out! You may have to type 'npm install' in the console before typing'npm run serve' to get the front end running. Let me know if you have questions!

Our product owner request bright colors and many gradients, and we also used the glassmorphism design style because we liked it, and to keep up with the current design trends. The look of the app is very important to me!

While there are improvements that I would like to make one day, I am proud of the app that we at the Let's Taco 'Bout It team were able to create! Thank you for taking a look!
